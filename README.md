# english-verbs

This repository contains a database of phonologically transcribed English verbs (present and past tense).

 - The notebook `Extracting phonological forms of English verbs.ipynb` documents data processing and origin.

 - Each row of `EngVrbs_present_past.tsv` contains a phonological transcription of a present tense followed by a past tense English verb.
 - That data is based on the database put together by Bruce Hayes and Adam Albright available from http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/rulesvsanalogy/RuleBasedLearnerEnglish.zip
